# eraft

Based on Etcd-Raft and implemented by C++, Eraft is a high-performance industrial Raft library. The main idea for this project comes from the manuscript of Diego Ongaro's doctoral thesis. At present, this project has been included in https://raft.github.io. We hope to explore the possibility of optimizing the existing algorithms on the basis of realizing a stable industrial Raft library. 

ERaft supports academic research projects on scaling out Raft to spot instances. One of our main work has been published in IWQoS 2019.

Another team of the same root is now working on a stable version called BW-Raft, which inherits the implementation from ERaft. One may refer the latest note from the Good Lab, (https://good.ncu.edu.cn)

#### Overview

Raft is a protocol with which a cluster of nodes can maintain a replicated state machine. The state machine is kept in sync through the use of a replicated log. For more details on Raft, see "In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm" (https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf) by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout.
